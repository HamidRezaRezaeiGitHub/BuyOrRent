### ðŸ§© Example

Title:
Fix theme toggle visibility â€” FlexibleNavbar component

Context:
ThemeToggle button disappears on mobile screens due to responsive classes. The toggle should be visible across all breakpoints for consistent theme switching.

Read before acting:
- src/components/navbar/FlexibleNavbar.tsx
- src/components/theme/ThemeToggle.tsx

Acceptance Criteria:
- ThemeToggle visible when enabled across all breakpoints (mobile-first).
- No overlap with other navbar elements on small screens.
- `npm run test`, `npm run lint`, and `npm run build` complete without errors.
- Component README.md is updated if necessary.
- Update Project Structure section of root README.md if new files/folders are added (or removed).

Constraints & Hints:
- Likely hidden by responsive classes (`hidden sm:block`, etc.) in FlexibleNavbar.
- Keep changes localizedâ€”avoid refactoring unrelated components.
- Follow existing mobile-first Tailwind patterns in the project.
